# EDA-Play-Store-App-and-Review-Analysis
The Google Play Store is a vast marketplace for mobile apps, with over 3 million apps available for download. With so many options to choose from, it can be difficult to find the right apps to be developed. That's where data analysis comes in. By analyzing data from the Play Store, we can gain insights into which apps are the most popular, which categories are the most in-demand, and which features users are looking for.This information can then be used to make informed decisions about developing the app in particular category.

In this project, we will conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Google Play Store dataset. We will explore the data to gain insights into the following aspects:

The most popular apps
The most in-demand categories
The features that users are looking for
The relationship between app ratings and downloads
The relationship between app price and downloads
We will use Python and the Pandas library to perform our analysis. We will also use the matplotlib library to create visualizations of our data.

The results of our analysis will be presented in a report. The report will include a summary of our findings, as well as recommendations for how to use the data to make informed decisions about which apps to be developed in which category.

We hope that this project will help you to better understand the Google Play Store and make more informed decisions about which apps to develop in which category.
